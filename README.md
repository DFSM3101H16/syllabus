Here you can find the course description, with assignments, links, and everything I want to give you.

## Using git
Git is a version control softvare, great for working on code both for yourself and especially when collaborating. There are three main ways to use git: local repository, repository on a server, or a repository on github. We could set up a git-server on the college, and that way deny others read access to our repository. Otherwise we have to pay github to make a repository private, which is of course a very small fee for a private company...

## Lecture notes
I will  upload all lecture notes here in this repository as time goes on, and for you to have the latest version of anything, all you need to do is to pull the latest version of the repository.

## Assignments
You can create your own repositories in this github organization, and then pull them down to your machine. There you can write code and commit it to your local version of the repository, before pushing it to the server on github. When you have done that, I can pull down the latest commits to your repository and see what you have done.

## Working as a team
You can write code together in pairs, possibly three in one team if we are an odd numbered lot. If you prefer working alone, I won't stop you, but I've found myself, that coding in pairs from time to time can be quite fruitful.


## Pulling repositories and modifying them
It's easy to pull repositories from github, and play with the code yourself. Then, providing the licenses provide for that, you can fork the software with any improvements you have made, you can possibly upload improvements on the code and so on.

As an example that I will use in our first lecture, I pulled [this repository](https://github.com/allanino/BallisticGame) to "make" a game using the Newton's second law in two dimensions with a constant acceleration. I tweaked the code to allow for arbitraty gravitational acceleration (g \neq 9.81).

## Coding language
There are of course many languages used in coding games and simulators.

## Book
We use "*Physics for game programmers*" by Grant Palmer. All the code for the games in the book can be downloaded from [the publisher's website](http://www.apress.com/9781590594728?gtmf=s).
